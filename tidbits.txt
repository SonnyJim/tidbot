AAB|Add-a-ball -- Allows the player to add additional balls by achieving a specific task 
EM|A pinball machine design that relies on relays, motors and switches to run. This design was phased out in the late 1970s. EM machines are easily recognized by their scoring displays that have mechanical score reels that spin to show the score. Newer machines are referred to as solid state (SS).

Woodrail|Pinball machines manufactured prior to appr. 1961 that used wood to frame the playfield glass

SVUK|Super Vertical Up-Kicker;   for when a regular up-kicker just cannot do the job.

mode|A configuration of the table where specific goals must be met in a limited time to score points, hitting specific lanes or dropping specific targets, sometimes combined with multiball.  Pat Lawlor takes credit for these.

Popeye|actually pretty good
Spinner|A rotating target, mostly placed at the entrance to a loop/orbit or ramp,   or a petite woman.

Licensing|obviously a big deal, and while these types of things have simply been accepted in the past, indie pinball (yes, I'm going to keep calling it that) is potentially a completely different beast altogether. Gathering copyright and likeness permissions is a huge, daunting process, but is very rewarding in the end. That being said, this is something you need to have reasonably taken care of before making any major an

hopefully there|a TWD code update right before it
WWE|still tbd
not everything|a home run but don't sleep on some of these titles
so there|a "gap' in the market for such a site then
Yes it|suprising that WWE didn't include a real bell that rings
local news|all a ga-ga over the winter storm warning
all i know|pin shit is expensive holy crap
black|harder, deadens the ball more
white|springier
my preference|whatever WMS (or whomever) made the game with.
marco for me|just too high priced

The comedy|well done.
PM|Pinball Magic

lol bags that|crazy priced
The gumball|your game ball, and if you flip it into the top gobble hole, you win, and not only do you get that ball dispensed to you, it drops one more.

The world|a horrible place. Instead of spending the resources to the best possible the corporations manufacture and sell junk based on planned obsolescence that will soon turn into wast so you have to buy the next model. Instead of providing washing machines to humanity they provide it to 2 billion reselling them every 5 years. ALso we are dependant on exponential economic growth but at 
3% growth|at the edge of a recession, they want at least 5-7%

if something|LGPL and it's statically linked, then your whole program is now under LGPL
GPL|just a license virus
wait... LGPL|more permissive than GPL (GPL is viral but LGPL is not)
GPL software|deliberately underpriced (free) in monetary cost, but has a price to pay in the form of this very big string attached to it, that you must agree to in order to legally use it.
So there|an actual lawsuit from the Nucore guys?  I was about to ask how they managed to track down the Pinbox guy but iirc the twat tried selling it
pin2k os|http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:sIAJGbpPEBgJ:www.videopenny.com/pinball/pinrepair/pin2000/xina.htm+&cd=11&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us

Paying by phone|cool until you have a login issue...  Then you lost your wallet
coin-op|competiting with all the gaming choices on smart phones.  those phones are charged.
the first hit|free
Waterfox|sporatically grabbing 25% of my CPU, and a GB of space.  i guess they want me to switch to chrome.
exception|something like Golden Tee Fore!, which has an actual card reader integrated into the game system, for reading player cards, and allowing credit card sales for tournament entries.
i guess he|close, with exhange.
msrp|5995 (Stern)
rgp2|dying the same death rgp is it seems
distribution|skewed 
Norway|a shit hole and a beehive, fuck this land of milk and honey
The industry|down and people aren't creating value, they are just providing services to eachother and paying tax.
All that|left is warehouses outside town and hairdressers
Even if the box|hardwired into the ignition I could see people bypassing it
man the alien|all u need 
Although he|saying that "We don't want to show anything that the licensor hasn't signed off on"
Stern|still making worse games than they did in 2003.
What could work|to make a kickstarter do donate money and make steve ritchi make one layout and lawlor make one based on a merge of previous ones, make them spend 3-5 years to get that as good as possible, then get some other dedicated people to write software and improve it for a decade to come.
LIS|the ultimate "Oh, you hit something?  Have a multiball!"
just right|better than more or less, because when it is less it's too little and when it's more it's overwelming
The game|overwhelming, he frowns upon it and walks away.
TZ instalitz|not counted for high scores though
But Kevinddr|the man to talk to about that
The problem|that it's to simple to bother practising 4 hours/day for 3 years to get good at it.
BBB|in IPDB twice, once for Capcom and once for IP
body|rusting out though sad enough

tidbot|being deliberately coy about FTH

sad how easy it|for them to get all that info
but June|a long way away, basketball-wise
fanbase|livid
maybe.  that|the series restart,  when she appears, or comes,  i don't know.
Heighway Pinball|very happy to announce that Aurich Lawson has joined the Heighway Pinball team ‚Äì specifically as Creative Director for their upcoming ‚ÄòAlien Pinball‚Äô game. Aurich is an artist, graphic designer and pinball collector from California. When he's not tinkering with pins or designing art packages for them he's the creative director for technology geek site Ars Technica
My guess|that he's sold about 30 FTHs so far based on pics of parts/people talking on forums
Wales|pretty screwed when it comes to manufacturing
My guess|that Aliens announcement put a bit of cash into the company through preorders and investor confidence
pinballinfo|the UKs version of pinside

MST3K|wearing a bit thin.

i like that ramp|a bash toy lol
Screen tearing|not hitting v-sync properly from what I remember
!pinZork|born

so 7 horus|7%, 5 qualifying games is 20%
everything|fresh made in s cafe
the sound|bland, art is the same green-haired chick drawn six times all over, playfield layout is dull, hardware sucks (horseshoe drops) .. there is absolutely no redeeming qualities about laser ball :(
Wow that|nice
oz|old now lol
chris|in the middle -- http://imgur.com/bVLw5m6
it appears he|setting up a factory to make pins.

Where|says "Post #7169", right click, copy link
   it|nice that some CC companies did just chargeback paypal.   ashame, all won't.
"Sandking"|the pilot of "The Outer Limits" show and presents a story very similar to "The Fly": an ambitious scientist that makes a mistake with his experiment, being affected and becoming insane with the transformation. The story is disclosed in a low pace, with reasonable special effects for a television show, but the character of Dr. Simon Kress looks like a "crazy scientist" since the 
photoshop|fun
509|spokane washington

Hodor|coming to an arcade near YOU!
waterworld|a lot of hit the middle to load the ship
if Tradaeu|next I'd agree, but borgie appears to be on
"cabinet style"|listed as "upright", but I would guess it's a basketball shooting redemption game, similar to the WMS Hot Shots
waterworld pin|pretty fun for a premier
small claims|5K limit
small claims|civil court
my point|... a detective is a law enforcement officier.
if the guy|convicted of a legal crime, that slam-dunks the civil suit.
thing|... that act of advertising is one crime ... taking the money from all the victims, that's another.
if the detective|smart,  he will kick this up to the federals , real quick.
and that|apparently what happened
1)|actually SELLING without the IP license, as well as intent to sell without the IP license
1)|clearly within intellectual property laws
2)|clearly theft
the difference|the victim ...
the dalek|only in 100 games
the mini-pf|very complicated for sure
tz clock|very intricate too, as is gumball machine
okay here|an example of what i mean
but there|no way in hell any day of the week that a game like that is better than those 2 
that game|just such a boat anchor
he says that he|near 70 years old.   yes, that is a different position.  <litz> Gary's in an enviable position ... his costs are nil, and his prices are sky high
The main part|working, I just need to add some IRC goodness to it
Dinklage|currently the funniest man on TV

the art|beutiful
$35|a years salary in the east
tebow pretzel|pretty funny too
Grass|for the bottomfeeding algaeaters (radioactive btw), the classy takes mushrooms or lsd.

freeman: When|next episode of Arya out to be pirated/vikinged
franchise|0-8 in the playoffs
whitewater|fun
I think Borg|backtracked to 2012 or even before now on finishing games
X-men|the best potential, but they did not fix the software and fine tune it
X-Men|just a Whirlwind with modes
broken|split in half 
and thing|... any box you see on a train, it's almost a 100% chance it's loaded
reagan national|also pretty neat ... you follow the river directly parallel to the Mall
Baseball|non existing here up north
Polo|a team sport played on horseback. The objective is to score goals against an opposing team. Players score by driving a small white plastic or wooden ball into the opposing team's goal using a long-handled mallet. The traditional sport of polo is played at speed on a large grass field up to 300 yards (274 meters) long by 160 yards (146 meters) wide, and each polo team consists of four 
since he|not Mercian, he can't be good.    his music does not sound unique.  i think he borrowed it.
that cap|big fucker
christ tinypic|useless now
while Steve|'the King', and I have a few games designed by him,  he seems to only tweak his designs.  i'm could be more satified with a recyled Gomez layout
right orbit|stupid tight
this one|built from a Stern LED display
stern|not in the business of making "great" games.
JJP|in the business of making great games.
competition|always a good thing
the jury|split.
jjp|not a true competition sorry to say
And spider man|cool MM copy cat since it has a horisontal ramp
but spidey|a great pin i hear

not sure if pro|different
*once it|on 
GOT|rumored to be coming
Harry Potter|a dead license now
abel game|here now lol
(that's if JP|a Warner franchise)
the cycle time|huge
three modes|grail shit
I think 3|only possible with battle the p
Chinese|good. "Mool lice sir?"
Launch party|in August
Even richie|just remaking the same thing forever
All I want|factory fresh s11 machines :p
Problem|I have no skills at fixing cars¬®
chrome|v nice 
i think that|reflection
And Roller King|the only machine with adrenaline
Taiwan|better, more expensive though
The USA|so 20 years ago, especially New York
This area|overdue for another "big one"
Star trek|nice enough except the rules and modes:p just put on a blindfold
Ant the layout|copycat Lawlor so no I am not sure
winner|you
whirlwind|bags fav game
the basement|pretty handy too
scoring strat|really start as many illusions as you can, don't play them
levitating woman|worth playing, that's the only one really
ilusion|like 4M
skill|2 I think
My guess|that they'll do all the high-end unlicensed WMS/Bally pins first
licensing|just a small hurdle, for a well run company.
Price|only a matter if you aren't really interested. If you are interested you will make it happen.
The problem|the hype and short runs, people don't have the time to settle and raise funds
170k|alot of pinball machines
but why?   that|an opportunity costs.
The government|a shark
Everything else|a crime.
Bussines|a ok, but not when everything costs 10x the value
10% business tax|ok and more than enough, instead we have 25% and 25% on top of that
freeman: That|just crazy
freeman: Norway|bankrupt, the next generation will be in debt to the neck
The secret|that they pretend the economy up here is good buy importing from the east and upping the price 10 folds, the bubble will burst when the new economy move east of sahara.
Nothing|made here that is worh having.
 he|building roads and bridges,  around the globe
but there it|;)
hence why LOTR|a great game
where|your god now ...
  kiss|number 49. 
"Jody Dankberg"|a pretty rad name
uhh|it? no one gave me any :P
Stern|in the business of manufacturing coin operated pinball machines.  Not satisfying pinheads.
kiss my ass|what i say
Nah CSI|ok, not really played enough 24 to comment on it
kiss|a famous band but i cant think of one song of theirs i know
rolling stones|kinda sad
mustank|a yawner,  but at least it has drop targets, and the silly ramp
bsd one|crazy and video mode kinda best 
party zone|one of them 
Layout|pretty crap on CFTBL if you ask me.  Everything else is top notch though
well maybe toy|somnething that interacts with the ball
 IM|better than many games.
  it|somewhat fun,   they missed the chance to used more of the Tony Stark humor
that crane thing|cool
tom|high priced:(
3x0.9 million|only 2.7 millions, clear out some more basements already, toss the people out.
TOM|way overrated for what it is, it's certainly no TOTAN
at least TOM|a decent layout
TOTAN|trash all around
one|flashing if you drop the flashing on the ramp pops up
pretty sure sr|got
All I've heard|rumours and nothing concrete
Or perhaps that|what he should do, but leave out that 3 bank target G-o_T
steve|got
Roger Sharpe|gonna be there! gasp
 DP sure|burning a lot of deposit money on travel, and shows.
ya that part|wierd
hmm time line|1980 so that would have thrown me anyway
fucking kids|fine, slapping a producer is not
"Caballero|likely to serve a full 15-year sentence because he was in jail on a felony cocaine trafficking charge within the last three years, A"
yep.  my wallet|safe, from this latest run of Sterns.  <lospat> so stern makes another pin thats a miss with me
But I guess CPU|cheap now
Golf farming|fun
kiss band|lame  but some of the tracks are good (DRC especiall) and I love music games, so actually a bit interested in it.   The freddy-gene thing is a turnoff tho :/
 like how|tidbot going to choose which pin?  haha     surprised no one caught that.   But Tidbot did in its answer  LOL
the actual sport|nuts https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxBUOEy_4H8
kabaddi|weird.. :D
my server|there
Food|pretty bland
and that|about it
HEP|doing something for him
his employer|making good cars again, he should have lots of cash!
too bad it GOT|not a JJP pin.
well well creech|unplugged
problem|finding places with enough space and thats busy and not having to deal with a full of shit owner or idiots who work there, not always easy
but fact|they are cheap and dont give much issues
big minus|and this is a big big minus atleast down here... every place already has one, and if they dont the owner dont see any point for u to put one in cause he can buy one himself cause not much can go wrong
pool|cool
The thing|I'm kicking around the idea of writing my own pinball simulator 'cause I *really* don't like Visual Pinball
spk|not a dynamic executable
wms afaik|just the waukegan plant
Goat Simulator|the latest in goat simulation technology. You no longer
  this|why Vegas will die.   
just do what jjp|doing
where the game|for instance maybe put on a timer instead 
the problem|at the part u uplugged
My point being|that you jump to conclusions without measuring anything
the problem|on the board, no need to even wonder
well here|where i kinda clicked too
  i know this|'high math',    but adding a diode,  increases the total system resistance,  thereby, lowering the voltage.
Clay|a pinball god, resistance is futile!
But this|just beating the dead horse.  Next time, take a multimeter, measure the voltage
the ultimate|when you have a WPC game and mis-plug the playfield coil/flashlamp power plug ... which puts +50 into the +20 power supply.
but this|learning , i fuck up i learn and hopefully not repeat
that thing|beyond fucked 
That TAF|more than fixable
The gumball|worth 500
That Black Rose|definitely fucked though
if the playfield|fine and most ramps etc look good.. u can save it
This item|cash only if picking up in person!!!!!!!!!!!!! These machines have parts missing(including boards, displays, translites, etc) and have serious water damage. These are to be considered as parts only. I figure the toppers alone are worth someones time.
   tidbot|such a buzz kill
6.8|a "meh" in Japan at this point
 here|an update from the factory -- http://i.imgur.com/nPmwi.png
his goal|low attendance, so things don't get crowded.
now that|fairly 'Murica right there ;)
WWF|not a turd
DE|represented
PB25|DE  yep
Op|very uinterested but needs to upgrade machines so playable.
they say 10|to 7, what 7 was to xp ...
I think WoZ|something like 60-90 seconds
Seems lospat|too impatient to wait 20 seconds, he wants instant gratification.
adjument|simple : turn counter clockwise until red light goes on, turn clockwise exactly 1/8th turn past the point where it goes off.
great to see ART|doing well over seas
lospat|drunk, again, reversed buttons
and that|SO EASY on taf
The skillshot|quite easy as long the spring is right and not sloppy
house|literally massive
i feel it|somewhat 
the one on mine|fuckeeed like u can see it just a tiny bit
music|nice
yea that|what i had at this one location i had to cut
next|game of thrones 
lazer war|a 2k game? wtf
lazer war|actually surprisingly fun to play
Yeah this|the video for the ring monitor, not the DMD
well the 1st|a fairly big hit.  probably worse than the 1M
next game|him
lospat: TZ|a joke, highly overrated, the sound is inferior, the artwork is a patchwork of stuff that doesn't fit together artistically and he didn't even get the logo right, although estes has done what he could the ruleset needs at least a year of tweaking and playtesting, it has no jackpot ramps or other cool stuff, it's just a heavy loaded playfield without something nice. The loop is 
The price|down and if you take the daily profits and divide it over 5 million heads isolated it would be better off gathering cans and soda flasks and hand em in, although if everyone did that you'd run out of flasks
Woz|a beutiful creation.  you should select it.
the artist|Youssi.  it means something to him.     and the largest fraternity on earth.
pinball|2 minutes of fun hitting a ball around
It's|a superior legaue to MK
better|a moving target
the journey|the reward bags
The worst|those Konami beaters
okay here|the thing
lospat: Clock|ticking, I wanted to make a game or a pin, but now I just want a woman and a baby :p
all on pinside|a threat about games that have shipped
well there|no hype for it down here at all 
t2|maybe one 
buf|apparneltu out
babcock|a hreat coach
Checkpoint|a shit game, even by DE standards
grav what|ur view on party zone? 
i think dr dude|better 
But EATPM|the best out of all that lot
eatpm|crazy expensive 
eatpm|just hit ramp ramp ramp ramp
humor|ok
sure there|some randomness
so all|safe 
anything|possible,  but select things are highly unlikely
price increase|sad
Now|the winter of our discontent 
now|the time if Lawlor pin is to my liking I'd buy a NIB
a loop|how many time you complete the door panel on a single credit
less|more
radical|too rare for me to ever see one bags
his job|done (Artist), likely got paid so releasing his works, guessing
well that guy|crazy good
tidbot|all knowing
because that|shit
No idea what it|now, I lose track of the bullshit
Stern|assaulting my facebook feed
t2|a good game
he Licensee|now underway to complete a master prototype Magic Girl‚Ñ¢. An announcement will be made as to when this will be, however the goal is to have it ready in time to unveil at an upcoming show. From this point forward, information and progress will be provided by the Licensee as Zidware is no longer in control.
"This group|currently in the process of negotiating with proven known quality manufacturers to get the games produced."
The steam train|running near here :) I can hear it from my work
mind you this|like thursday at papa
UPS depot here|in roswell, all of 3 miles away
Sonny_Jim: AMH|a 15k line single file, you tell me.
The AMH code|a fucking nightmare, and Ben admits to that :) I had to do a LOT of work to get the system stripped down enough to run the Pinball Circus code.
P-ROC|just too bare in terms of library functions, the AMH hardware is a bit too 'weak'
IDA|the tits though
Apparently rc4|still secure enough that even if I know enough of the plaintext it's not going to be feasible to crack it
WTF|a "jump drive"
 i feel jpop|incompetent, but did not start out to steal.
Blowoff|English slang for fart
Pre-order|dead
B.  There|no mystery investor

bags ur problem|like some people i know
What good|that when you want a wedding and a baby=
ur problem|u are never satisified
tz|a better game im sorry
Nowadays society|full of distractions, you need to keep focus every day and be really disciplined, a newspaper or a single email is enough to ruin an entire workday
John|really passive, though.  So when you do cut him off, and you're a resource that he "needs", then he gets apologetic pretty damn quickly.
Addiction|a bad thing
If it|too complex to complete in one sitting it is not for you
Immagine|you had to save a pinball game and continue another day:p
Fire!|a fun game.
The RC4 key|basically part of the AES 128 key
So his idea|to use that to squirt in videos
"This|my email from the detective. Since then i have been in contact with Agent Kraudelt and it doesnt get any better. Hes basically said that people have been receiving refunds who want them and paypal has been working with us to send our requested refunds.
that story|still alive heh
well|the coffin of twd
err  bloodbath|the coffin 
head|folded down onto lower cabinet
yeah smoke|the worst
stuff like that|why I haven't donated a penny to the place.
a right to drama|your reward
dilation|in your future
my guess|pre-1995ish
on|joe schober, which makes sense because he worked at aol all his life, and she was there for some years
seems jen|a writer? perhaps she did work with comptia for some of their pieces
my guess|it was long enough ago there's no hurt
SDTM|good for Stern.  Means more coindrop
TWD|the same
life|good
Fred|so cool.  he entertains everyone up and down the halls of expo.
"Once the game|finished we will all be able to see if its even worth making.."
"Once the game|finished we will all be able to see if its even worth makin"
grav there|no way
"Bottom line|this, the only reason Zidware customers are trying to sue or put Zidware in bankruptcy is because they think there is money to be had."
15k on met|like 1 switch
freeman pinball|bad. its like cocaine u buy one but its never enough, before u know it u have a living room full of them
end player|level 1 of crazy.. when u start to stack them ontop of each other there is no help for u anymore
xwnon sound|real good
black hole there|my vote for one . not bally but most likely one of the best
looks like there|space for a couple in there
Every shot|lit, then you hit a post and go straight down the middle...
hockey|great in surround sound anyway
feeling lazy|something that tells u to get ur ass off the couch
Tidbot|smart :D
oh nice pinside|resppnsive html now finally no more zooming on phone tablet!
pinside|better on every phone other than iphones apparently
yes there|Lospat, MG disappears
ST|hit this shot x many times, oh wait after that hit that same shot x many more times.   blah
my WOZ monitor|getting blurry and wonky
ZAC|in at 160, LFS is in at 151
141|the highest possible 8th place finisher (if those people get a 35)
This math|killing me
doing 2|even worse
and the art|an elephant being pushed up the stairs to the attic
the soldering|not so bad
well problem|that the legs where short already 
Jurrasic Park|fun as is.  
JP|nothing like whirlwind
JP|the poorman's TAF
WW|similar to JP is similar to TAF is similar to NGG
The Machine|also great, nothing quite like it
SDTM|more money in the coin box
This guy|hilarious, he is making a home made pinball machine out of the Funhouse ripoff, the machine is already made in late 1990 ffs!
Dredd|the best super pin and the super pins are the best :p
JP|far more fun than the DE Time Machine.
jp|one of DEs best games
100% that|Paypal forcing the issue
Apple's system|quite compatible with Apple's ecosystem!
Idiocracy|turning out to be a documentary rather than fiction
and apple|virus free :)
HP|a realm of material to pull from.
Hp|mind controll, but original themes have them too
bah since when|that $4k
thing|will it sell
problem|everyone wants a i thing 
My avg|29 per 50 for last year
percentaging|usually legal
CJ of course|local here to norcross
litz: And that|both us and europe
but the show|a black n white one
TZ|like the holy grail for color dmd I think
FT|damned fun
FT|a fun game
Pinball|dead, just a few stubborn overgrown kids, after that, nothing
My LOTR|being operated again, in SF now, I haven't checked in a while but from what I hear it's making a mint
their music|used everywhere
ACDC|making a mint also, that's a game I always have to wait to play, somebody's always on it
What game|it?  <gravitar> http://imgur.com/vOPvkeg  hint
all this means|skit-b agreed to pay before they were forced to.
multiball|really good for scoring too though especially because it lights the spinner
the bottom part|used if you have something like THING
then he|personally liable O_O
except pinball|actually superior to modern games
vinyl|for chumps! besides the big art!
the PinlIfe gig|way overcrowded to even consider going to
TZ|not that good, too me it feels like putting together alot of various stuff without adjusting it to fit.
The art|worst, kind of 3-4 different styles stapled together
option 1|always popular
jackbot|WPC
TPA|great for auditioning games
the difference|that i burn through credits faster
Also stuff|harder under pressure than at home
Chance|you can insta drain 3 balls and lose vs the worst player in the world
Pinball|a non beatable box designed to take your dollar within 3 minutes on average, noone ever won but a few were amused. Wether you play at home or at a location, your pockets will be emptied.
Pinball|just a scam like my can of pommegranate cider. It has 0,5% pommegranate juice
More storage|better when it comes to storing samples I guess
Jersey Jack|going to push that timed pinball now. "Let everyone on a even playing field."
Everything else|non essential
food|one of the best joys in life
Wheat|the worst, rye is slightly better
profit|key to survive in business
bags pinball|a coin operated device... they are made to take money
unless he|selling for a fortune maybe
this seller|not gonna do that for me
but this oak|someone normal not a pinhead
All I'm saying|that it's highly likely they aren't going to get it ready for shipping properly, unless you tell them
that game|long gone now thankfully
but something|up with it
hmm this|not good news lol
My impression|that he's simply a rich dude who thinks he can somehow magically make it happen through pouring money into it
a lot of it|stylized though, so I don't know what they'll do about that if anything
funnny thing|they changed the disc area due to the disc doing nothing to the ball
My guess|that the guy showing the MG pin knows very little of the nitty gritty of pinball
BOM|Bill of Materials
6 modes|overkill in many machines
To me pinball|much like progressed music, It has gone too far.
thing|that alot more games are going to home owners now bags
My game|best
spike power|totally different
But the idea|that it's cheaper to assemble and 'easier' to fault find
the lawyer in me|raging
even though it|June and probably 100-billion degrees out
haha  party bus|a wiinning idea
well 7|nice cause it's divisable by 4 . . fuck, it's not

link|also to Game Room Guys
Sears website|now a link collector of sorts
T2 manual|pretty crap and all, doesn't have the colours for the flipper wiring
Demoman|the best ramp-fest game made
but the game|just this totally drab, lifeless shit
#pinball|pretty old, been around since before RGP
The machine|completed parted at the moment, gotta rebuild the glove its making ALOT of noise.
jm|cool the video mode is abit iffy
since no casual|EVER shooting any of the mode start shots
everything else|the same
rick|no fool.  he likes money.   sell 15-50 games, and than sell service parts.
making pinball|hard,   quote the Kulek
(which|nothing, and almost certainly no money back)
country music|just shit
No way|SC worth that much
some the coil|mounted on the scoop
"Sounds like he|making arrangements. "
"No one|going to say where it is at now for safety, obviously. "
that game|a serious tangible asset.  no doubt it would sell for big $$
SC token design|two coils ... shuttle pulls from two token tubes.
anything at SFGE|exhempt, because it's all freeplay (and techincally is a "trade show")
swipe|the way for sure now
sms payment|good
what we need|a way to interface to that.
that met|nuts. snake randomly throws it in left outlane
wtf|up with that jp sound
spinner|one
unless there|5 then include Targets
last game listed|Lost In Space
Tip:  Duck|considered a red meat and many prefer to eat it rare or medium rare.  If you want your duck more well done, cook the duck a bit longer in each step of the stove-top cooking; if it appears to be cooking too fast, just lower the heat so that you can cook it longer without getting the surfaces too dark or leathery. 
Heighway Pinball|coming to Pintastic New England!!!!!    Pre-order early, pre-order often!!
USA|a shithole right now.   Blacks think they can protest and commit violence with impunity in the name of racism.
bro this shit|all over thenews here
And that|just everage talk, when they are angry or upset you don't wan't to know what they say and it wouldn't be possible to translate it either.
Twitter|finally removing the 140-character limit in Direct Messages. Starting next month, users can send DMs the that are up to 10,000 characters in length.   Twitterers rejoice!!
how high|a stern boxed pin on its back (trucking side)
well your hobbit|delivered to your door right? so that's not so bad :)
O&E|the pawn stars $5k pin
t2|surely better than this
I think Kiss|the first stern without a bash toy/mech
the question|how much it costs to develop a given table
what the fuck|this tpa update
twice a winner|me today.   League and after league tourney champ 
the board|interesting ... has standard switch/lamp matrix
Nothing|hard, just some guys taking on to more than they can handle.
Season 3|out,  Orange in the new Black.

wow that|big 
the story|recent.
ben|not at spooky any longer, new guy doing code for #2
the PCB|interesting
but it|on pinside
blind|important
copper|copper.
bags blind test|the must todo
The sad now|that they just updated their amplifier model too:S
The price list|updated may 1st 2015 and it says new
That img|from 2012, getting confused now
umm ... there|really no such thing as a proprietary connector.  You can always buy a matching plug.
a cable|WIRE.  and I guarantee you it does not contain a coil, unless it's got a pretty big box attached to it.
everyone|glued to a mobile device
unless that wire|wound around itself, there IS NO COIL, and therefore no inductance
part of that|pricing going up, part of that is just regular inflation
Going to school|hard:S
typing|hard
the catch|you can wear any Florida team apparel inside
because nfw sony|reupping the old incarnation
what I heard|comic book art.  that seems to be making it onto pinside now too
his character|the start of a mode!
well arnie|the guess but I'm trying to remember them all
3 table voices|a fun one
gravitar: This|the "Rescue Edition" version
Everything else|repro
crap.  Stern|teasing me.   gravitar> newest pin rumor new SPidey (Stern) will get remade
my guess|that TZ's is WAY more "programmed" that most DMDs where they are more-or-less movies played
town square|a huge problem for sure
all of AP|me though
Gottlieb|a real bitch from what I hear, the lawyers that hold it are sharks
Yeah Big Hurt|decent, I like some of the layout on WW
batman|to much a grind game
and this ...|why I live in a house.
All that|missing is the backmounted drums gipsy style
pinball|evil
My house|garbage
learning rules|really helpful at pinburgh
TZ|so mean
sorcerer|great
Although it|interesting to hear that it doesn't have the tip on the coil plunger
the price|set by supply and demand curves.  you are not marrying the game.  buy one, enjoy it, sell it.  <omarrr> cant believe some of the prices in the US
i think Michgan|halfway through their Kiss launch parties.  one tonight at M Brew
present code|very laughable, not even a true representation of a game, pathetic
NBA|as rare as a unicorn
gary|shut :D
if the lawsuit|to be believed, jack grealy enjoys spending other people's money
pinball|a device that if u compare it to a car its really awfull in design
all that|a loop
Commercial music|piss, the average guy never has heard good music, the average dj cannot play good music because they have never heard any of it. They have not even ever been to a party good shits.
Nowadays music|all focused on the vocals, it doesn't even have a prober bassline, and if it has it is for some short 20 seconds building up to the chorus.
My album|still Work in progress so perhaps I shouldn't speak too loud until I have delivered.
This server|doing my head in
i know i know so|the entire comminity
Pingolf|great.
problem|price is not always right
here soccer|known as soccedr
thing|im trying to find games that have longer legs
well a dmd game|proven to me that they pull more money
Pinbot|a bit early
but nobody else|prepared todo it
Hoarders on TV|like a picnic in the park compared to my junk cellars :p
30 - 100 modes|what keeps people intrested for longer i think
At least that|what I have on the "drawing board"
This way|win. A freeloader is a selfish and undeserving user of resources in private and personal spheres, e.g. an uninvited guest's abuse of friends and family's hospitality. (For unpaid overuse of public resources in public sphere, see free rider.)
problem|its too popular there
sonnyjim|who you want
building pins|hard but building a few pins together is impossible aka jpop
my *railcar*|worth more than my car.
if the cartoon|your manifesto of the plan to be carried out,   , that's not a 'cartoon',  thats a crime plan 
if the void|the size of large sized quarry, yes
ripleys|a nice game
double flipping|typically EOS switch troubles,  or frayed wires to the coil
if the machine|TZ, i would inspect, wiggle the wires to the coil, and cut/reflow them if suspect
Not sure if AMH|running into issues, or if they use different optos rather than WMS opto assemblies.
i think there|a 'technique' for wpc doors.   sputtering/ dripping
austin|not that bad a game, actually
lospat: Pinball|everything...
AP|better than many of the solid state games made.  
problem|the ones who have the tafs keep them lol
lol sof|the worst game i have now if thats what u maen
also space|an issue
our president|the worst in this 
hes house|like a mansion and they just increased hes pay
if history|any indicator....
Year|half over, so far participated in 20 pin leagues / tourneys.   Last year participated in 49 all year.   So far so good on NYE resolution to cut back.
The Rock|in town filming a movie, he should come over and play it
Howie|a friend.  His wife had to have TOM.   then, they sold it so she could have RFM.  that stayed.  oh, she likes RoadShow too.
ToM|the most popular game
toms ruleset|abit weak
well taf|a deeper game
250x5 million|1,25 billion points
At least there|a multiplier cap :p
ngg|under rated surely
The issue|that you cannot progress pinball without putting up the production costs
AFM|probably the last innovative game made.
and then their|titanic ... which had sales solely off females drooling over dicaprio
USA|fucking backwards in many respects
pride|pretty silly, i won't deny that
AFM|open and uncluttered, not any lawlor.
problem i have|that some games they dont finish if they dont sell well
pinball|still abit too basic for me\
Germany|victorious!
wooo drone|back
if there|the slightest buildup of charge, that makes for a very large potential
a 'charge' | basically 'seeking' ground
Lightning|a very mysterious thing.  When I had the cablemodem incident, I checked the cable the next day.  The "tree" in the distribution box was connected to rebar driven into the earth.
so okay there|the start
bobby there|a solution
but i guess jjp|doing it right? 
that game|from 1983
but the theme|right 
if the designer|steve... u can take a risk if theme is legit
metallica|so good i dont like music pins but its one i would want without thinking twice
terminator 2|one of the best action movies ever made
Robert Patrick|good in T2, the rest is just average
predator|ace
Alot in there|doomed to dail on wear, the scoop frames, the one above skill shot too, the gate below skillshot, the diverter on right ramp
if it|faster it will either bee too slow or bounce out and then hit the ball on the way down breaking plastics or going a drain
problem|not that is was on route
problem|that the guy on route did not take care of it
Even the dialog|taken
Avatar|probably a ripoff from Call me Joe
I know 1/4"|used on the coin door bolts
HS|sys11 ...
so|Pinbot
dunno if this|the case where you are, but there's enough other scrubs at the local bar tournaments that i've been able to win some matches
this tournament|free to enter with prize money - go get it!
everything|over priced
MET|a great game, i have nothing with the theme, but man, that game is fast.
Remember this|dumbed down
roadshow|complex
Krona|weakened again so they will bump stern NiBs again, 5th time in a short time
Vett|quite good but he does only stern tables
for instance bsd|hard
scared stiff|easy
Well the spiral|fun in TZ, that's about it
And it|nice to load the gumballs
One nice thing|that on the first multiball when you start it from the ramp and not the lock
no machine|perfect
and Nasty Car|100%
Perhaps the rod|bent
the US economy|stronger.
Chance|that pinball interesst will decay 5 years down the road
antidote|just 33% of total eclipse and took too much coke in his ibiza years."
hope tidbot|right.
redemption|child gambling
lospat: Seems it|cheaper to buy TZ parts in the USA than from england
likely|that something will break
The spring|not a shooter lane
The new hoard|pinball mods, it's funny how many mods you can squeeze in. There's like 270+ mods for TZ :p
doing stuff|hard
but|a European Economic member, if that makes sense
shit|garbage
hopefully kiss|a little better
WWE|very prone to ball hops just like avenger was
4pmET|Gerry Stellenberg - Multimorphic P3   PIntastic on Jareds stream
manual|WoZ material
(our chat|better than theirs)
also|the playfield wood very thin? compared to williams... i mean i can see it flexing :( that cant be good
The thing|that Stern Pinball can make good games if they want to.
ST|fantastic imo, but those missions aren't fun for me:S
TWD|good but software is dumb
twd not everyone|impessed with it... great theme , just not on par with what borg can do..
metallica|gret
Kiss|ok I think if they fix software
But the cost|too high for a theme I don't like
Monopoly|great if you can ignore the music
metallica|a big name
The ramp or loop|lit, hit it or miss. Not some dumb have the ball bounce on the jets and randomly lite some lanes.
thing|i never worked on a light like that 
multimeter|a powerfull too
Pintastic|awesome! hope it happens annually
taxi|just easier to understand for me
diner|better looking for me surely lol
Diner|the worst game of 1990 and 1990 is the year with most good games:p
spooky|on game 2 and they will get it done cause they have done it before so thats good
lol and that|not the reason why it was the worst
Pinball 2k|like Doing R&D directly on the customers as doing product testing. It should have been discontinued before production.
as soon as money|involved people want a cut
mixing|more important
but if the song|bad all the mixing and mastering in the world wont make it better
otherwise there|nothing special about the ballast; it's pretty much the same thing as is in the top of 8-zillion video games.
aint about what|profitable
Pat Lawlor|making pinball for pocket change and if he did something else he'd get 100x or 1000x.
Women|the opposite
key phrase|"legitimite acquittal"
design|part of the job
Even if he|guilty it would be several reasons he should be free
Layout design|like connecting dots in a book for kids
being the 1 seed|fun 
my guess|going to be a battery that failed started the fire.
ipdb says it|a version of http://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?id=968 but it's not really.. because that one didn't have the outhole gate
ballsaver|lit, or not
ya  $1|a waste per game
MB|Monster Bash
TZ|TWIZZIGLIGHT ZIZZZOOOONNEEE BITCHES

All I have|a 1/4" nut driver, couple of screwdrivers and a soldering iron
latest|End of Sept for hobbit production start.   hrmmm
Not every clear|the same as not every painting is either, some make art and some make junk
My best|7,4 and then I had litz 5 times 
think mine|like 12billion with 6 litz's
My machine|rough, it goes to the outlane if you don't shake it every time
twd|a pain
The ramp|a bit cool, when it's working
Wind|easy, just shoot scoop until ramp is up and force multiball
WW|always hard
yeah that|pretty much necessary (the magnet)
the Pre tourney|in the system today
Where|the Terminator Genisys machine? No, they want to make Kiss and WWE and what not. I hope that Ritchie is working on something useful.
metallica|good
Metallica|ok
This JJP|too abiciouse, the playfields are over the top without providing nice gameplay.
They payment|too low so all will say no.
Walking dead|barely fun, the rest not so much
The crossbow|cool, but it has several issues
Austin Powers|just some earlier rendition of Iron Man.
Music|not the most important factor, but if it has bad music or sfx I won't be able to play it.
and MET|across the street
the arcade|nice
gas|cheap here
My new car|tiny
currently it|a monthly fee in perpetuity
Jared|a promoter for sure.   Likely over promoted a few Stern things and feeling the backlash.
PC|being remade by Loftin crew
haha|this a joke: "Pinbo Metamorphosis where you turn Pinbo into a sexy elephant"
metallik|playing
that display|lcd no doubt lol
i mean music|done, artwork was done, layout done, etc etc
M'Brew leauge|starting
 rick|playing good cop (him),  bad cop (Chicago coin)

this channel|old
the oldest|Chicago Expo
freeman: Digital|best. Compete online.
Zen|okay...  I have enjoyed PA more since I bought it though (which was only recently)
Theater|great
Silver Slugger|one of the best games. If you think otherways you haven't played it or don't get the skills.
Scared Stiff|fun, though
what sucked|that it was my league game
AFM|great
Creature|fun
the multiball|hard. just two balls and no ball save.
creech mutiball|too hard
Pinball|very niche now
fish tales|a bitch 
well problem|if u get mutiball on fish tales u have to shoot twice into the casters clubs
the machine|a one shot game sadly
Gate on mm|broken most of the time :S
the theme|cool
TAF and TZ|like 2.3k in scandinavia
The dollar|way up so the value is way down
pinbot|a landmark game but its very basic... and will get bored real quick

Anything|available unless you're in the wrong zone.
My zone|always right.  It's all others who are wrong
LotR|cheap unless mint
Avatar|semi decent
xenon|too old bags its classic bally but u will bore of it too quick
Star Gate|better than most WMS
ripleys|a nice game
Although nothing|really original. Most is taken from 1976 sesame street pinball
How likely|it that most people tasted less than 10 units of the national dish in 35 years, a dish heavely marketed on Tv.
The base|alot larger than the steady numbers because everyone has a higher chance of tasting something new to them
The factory|running 24/7
4.6b|"more than 460 million" :)
so that|about all I know
JJP|doing a twitter giveaway
"1 mph|around 1.5 feet per second. So at 15mph you're at 22 ft/sec. Figure the length of the pf at 4 ft, and you can cover the entire length in 0.2 seconds. It feels faster because it's such a small surface."
fish tales|a superb game
FT|a lot of fun
shrek|coolish but i kinda wish there was another ramp 
demoman|a ramp-fest
unless that toy|the medieval castle
medieval|dull for tournament play
the video mode|abit too much points in afraid 
football|their thing
the T2 one|just bizarre
product|still sold, so not stopped - good to hear
whitewater|a must own
and this|aleady oit
Your 't' key|broken.
the lever|gone!!!
the show|declining in popularity quickly too
guess red matter|now yellow matter  
the net result|the same: of those 16 players, 8 live, 8 get to come back next year
viewership|the motivator
ya time|the constant factor
talking|up there though...
winning|impossilbe :D
PAPA|worth mon off... dunno about flipout, esp since the place is a ghost town after 2p
If Hobbit|shipping by EXPO then I'll go.   That's the determining factor :)
if stern|smart,  insert laugh, they'd wait till after LE's have sold
Pro|best
what the hell|issac binding? you seem to play that or dawn does
and free|a great price
yes that|a great site for that type of vehicle
and this|how you fix it : http://www.litz.org/pics/2011_06150004_1024.jpg
Lawlor|a good 3rd or 4th, but he has nothing to stand up to MB or AfM
legal|a scheme too :p Making something legal doesn't make it legal.
High scorelist|Jarre
the link|meaninglrss
so|the ifpa submission :D
the details|what wr are reading
nah once ay pbl|enough lol
round of 128|still qualifying
if round of 128|run like NCAA good luck
I heard Shepard|spear heading that part :)
matchplay.events|awesome
sky|sups
so when|woz comingggg 
Life|but a game
My part|done, when next we meet we will be enemies once again.
Most of the feel|from having proper buttons
Next|mechanical action and vibrations
TPA|awful at best.
Location|nice for testing stuff, for regular play, no way
The appeal|lost on me
state|divided up
OH i believe|Evan Bingham
KY I think|back to Fugate, I believe the plan is Zanzabar
If it|out it is leaked
If it|out its by someone unserious that stole others work and leaked
Stuzz: My part|done, when next we meet we will be enemies once again.
Soundtrack|suitably crazy
Heh.  Mild|good.
This weekend|biting cold.
lospat: This|the musical bible. First Goa compilation to be released in 1993. Good year that one :p
To me this|a religious experience.
Deadpool|scary :S
facebook|always up, just manually skip the load balancing on their server
The Krona|down again
dead flip|playing got on twitch
nothing|gonna fix shitty artwork
the art|bad, but lots of good games have bad art
stream|dead jim
Pro|best
stream|back up
The music|getting annoying on GoT
But this|old footage now.
Dragon|twitching like mad in the stream, having a seisure.
thing|22 years later and new pins still dont blow them out the water
freeman|making space for GoT now
problem|they are too small to produce enough frequency 
there sure|differnces 
the side-by-side|amazing
Hey guys! Time|coming close.  Looking for volunteers again. This year we will have a registration desk so if anyone prefers doing that instead of score keeping let me know.  We are also taking more people in the main division and starting finals on  Saturday morning so may need less overall people and the only score keeping on Saturday will be in Classics.
i hear encore|3 parts so yea, could use it there some
problem|with taf is everyone wants it
MM|supposedly the king of earnings
look at who|saying that
woz|far on the horizon cause i need to make big bank to even attempt one
shrek|a famous brand too
and the machine|in perfect shape... has color display also... leds the works
see here|the problem
lol thing|those people just come to play whatever spor they are and then leave
the arcade game|the bait
  that|how you measure your little p
big buck hunter|not a bad game to play 
My best so far|17/30 or so...  I'm getting higher each time
yes|a tough one
twd pro|paletable
$15|the going rate though
Bags|our channel curmudgeon. the only flipping he does is with his middle fingers :-P
and philly|closer than jfk to jjp whq
though ewr|closest
so there|obvious tension 
EPC|here! Lyman is here! Unfortunately the game is still on 110V/60Hz and we need an update for this, because we are 220V/50Hz. Gary Stern is on the plane to help us resolve this. The stream will be delayed until we have this fixed tomorrow. Sorry for this, but we will keep you updated.
goal|to eventually line that up
rarity|the kicker
stern|the only company that's managing actual mass production though
spooky|essentially hand assembling one game at a time
JJP|essentially hand assembling small batches, maybe a dozen, at a time.
the R&D|the same
factory labor|going down due to roboticization
the R&D|around the world, as are the suppliers, and now,  the plants
JJP|pretty much the only "collect deposits in advance" manufacturer that has actually produced product.
  this|back, when Jack was the number one distributor,
WMS brand|still used
so that|why the share the same trademark script
sc|safecracker
Jake|hilarious in everything he does, so I have high hopes
guessing rob|looking it over in private :)
Thought|was 84 or 85
excuse|that it's my birthday weekend, so I might stay where I am and hang around with my mates
35|half dead
expo|Pinball event in chicago that all the pinball industry hub knobs attend
gravitar|I Bo-Lieve!!
The !tell thing|semi useful but it's not stable enough at the moment
keefer|not in the tidbit database.  Also something about recursion
noone|not a word.  It's *No* *One*
java|so yesteryear
javascript|Like a bike with the training wheels, except there is no bike, just training wheels
now that|a unique machine!
they're goal|selling premium remixed audio for games
the owner|providing the software (and in essence, the license)
hobbit|How many coins does it take to play the new "Hobbit" pinball machine?       It doesn't, it takes Tolkiens.
JJP|an EVIL PINBALL-PATENTING ORGANIZATION
that work|stolen when another person copies the end product
well my stance|that IP is garbage, so it all falls under that!
my POV|the layman's POV
the tickets|an evolution
all you do|annoy people
The thing that|weird, is in manuals for pins going back at least to the 80s.. they mention hooking up redeption stuff to the knocker..
stern|more than happy to keep producing 6000 lunchboxes because people keep buying them
but it|giving a custom reward for an achievement... hehe..  
WWE skillshot|hitting the power switch
WWE Special|switching it off

All mine does|hangman
drunk history|https://pinside.com/pinball/forum/topic/roger-sharpe-story-on-drunk-history
JeremySm: That|stressfull. A good game on LoTR takes like one hour, starts to feel like work. Perhaps I am old and tired, but I prefer 3-5 minutes game like S11.
The feeder flap|the easiest
My Whirlwind|malfunctioning. It kicks out the ball when I shoot the lock :/
My guess|that something in the precompiled curl lib I am using is fucked, but meh
that design|unique in that it has an UP coil, with a ledge to hold the ramp up, and a knockdown coil, to lower the ramp
pinball|fun!
Play|the easy part.  Practicing I don't know how to do
title|wrong, though ... is an ex-TWA L1011 engine
(Whitewater|no better)
My goal|to beat Bowen

O_o|like an eyebrow raised..  one eye bigger than the other
(_)__)|wonky testicles
bhz|the testicles expert
gauntlet|a great game if you can get a few peoiple playing it
A friend of mine|pretty dope at it but it doesn't really spark an interest in me
Then pinball|a better formula. 3 balls per credit, have fun.
my friend|20 minutes from your home in cape town.  would you DJ his party for free? just 3 hours.  it will be good exposure for you.
all i need|simple good quality photos close up of a dr who so i can make vectors... 
(said plow|inch thick steel.  Didn't even scratch the paint)
My Thinkpad T420|very close to the Optiplex as well. 
Noise floor|a bit more pronounced too.
space shuttle|older than pinbot
Jackbot|weird
bride of pinbot|my favorite from the pinbot line, although doctor who plays similiarly to the pinbots as well
Cancer|back :(
Dr Who|kind of underrated.  Had one for awhile and I liked it

The Licensee|now underway to complete a master prototype Magic Girlô. An announcement will be made as to when this will be, however the goal is to have it ready in time to unveil at an upcoming show. From this point forward, information and progress will be provided by the Licensee as Zidware is no longer in control.
This group|currently in the process of negotiating with proven known quality manufacturers to get the games produced. As soon as this is contracted, purchasers will be notified and given a forecast of the timeline to complete development as well as release dates for final product. As it stands today, the anticipated timeframe until production of MG is approximately 2 years or sooner.
This plan|for you, the Pinheads that want something that is a true work of art, quality built that can be treasured for years to come. I have now found the right business team that is dedicated to try to get my work to the finish line and into production. Help me to help you get what you came to Zidware forÖa pinball machine that you will be very proud of to have in your collection!

the route|on
ok  here it|in parts.
- Intention|to put out 3 titles a year, to take advantage of the swappable mechanic of their cabinet. Vast majority of underlying components are modular, so design to production should be pretty swift. Could have as many as 8 titles out by end of 2017. - Seems pretty bullish generally about their prospects, Alien, and thinks Barry Oursler is great & considers him a legend** Pleasant guy to talk to. Would have asked far more, 
of course always|at this time

Buy in game|ST:TNG and RaTRS

Indy|a special game since the pf is open and everything else needs a clear hit.
Seems there|no story to be told, just money milking.
Star Wars|quite cool, but Lucas messed it up from the start making it a 6 hour story and putting the end from episode 6 in episode 4 and blowing up the Death Star twice.

that fix|still in the game today.
that process|'logically' simple, but is difficult, and requires great care.
but that|another story all together.. lets just say surface mount sux

marcos one|better cause it tests more things
I believe that|how Nucore got approved (payment to both Gene and Wayne)
the "EM" part|because the controlling logic is electro mechanical
Consensus|that the MOSFET *should* be able to handle it, but it may be that Stern boughtload of chinese knockoffs
Another theory|that they stuffed up the FPGA code and it doesn't PWM properly
met|a sam game not a spike game
Anything else|just a game
